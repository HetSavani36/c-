// tree is non linear data structure
/*
    ->it has multiple nexts
    ->heirachical data structure
    ->next are known as childrens
    ->leaf node: with no child
    ->root node:the main node it child are known as child node
    ->size=no of nodes
    ->edges :- is = to size-1.
    ->height :- is = to level -1


-->important properties of trees
    ->traversing done by depthfirst search breadth first search(DFS BFS)
    ->it has no loops and no circuits
    ->it has no self loop
-->types of trees lec-1:time 16:00

-->binary trees: upto two child nodes
-->balanced binary trees: for every node ,the difference between th levels of lst and 
    rst should be atmost 1.

    -->degenerate binary trees: 0 or 1 child
